Posted my notes on the youtube video thread:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eJeT4vWASg
Notes:
@1:10 : To use spring we need to add the spring related .jar files.
http://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/spring/

﻿﻿@1:59 Here, you will find the exact dependencies information for the MVC project
if you are going to use Maven or Gradle:
http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/
The link above also happens to have a short hello-world tutorial
that goes over dependency injection.

@2:12 All Required .jar files will be in the "libs" directory

@2:33 Pasting .jars into "lib" folder of PROJECT in Eclipse solution explorer.
This seems like a good way for me to get started.
However, when I know more about Spring MVC, hopefully I will
find there are other ways to do this. I imagine this could bloat the file size
of my project necessarily. I am interested in hearing the pros/cons of this method.

@2:44 There is one more .Jar needed. "Commons Logging"
@2:52 You may download commons-logging.jar from this link:
http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/download_logging.cgi

@3:05 Mouse over commons-logging.jar file to COPY
@3:09 Mouse over lib folder to PASTE into

@3:18 "Last but not least, we will need a web server."
@3:20 Any server providing Servlet/JSP technologies is suitable.
Did you say "Servlet" or "Server"?
@3:26 : Tomcat, WebLogic, WebSphere, GlassFish, JBoss Etc.

@3:33 : Will be using Apache TomCat server for this tutorial.
Awesome, because that is what my current project is using!

@3:39 Steps for downloading Apache TomCat server.
All of presenter's tutorials Spring MVC tutorials will use TomCat server.
Download URL: http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
Need help: His email is displayed on screen.

A bit confused on if I need "core" or "deployer"
Going to go with "core" and just unzip it in C:\DEV\JAVA_TECH\TOMCAT
If I get stuck, might want to look at this:

@4:17 Next tutorial will go over integrating our project with the TomCat server.
