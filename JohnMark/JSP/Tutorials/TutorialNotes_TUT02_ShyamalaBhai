NOTE: I think this project was started with
      the "New Java Project" option.

@:1:10 setup java tomcat by clicking "servers"
@:1:29 Cant Find "servers" tab?
            Window --> Show View --> Other --> Server --> Servers --> OK
@1:48 Click server tab. New Server WIZARD.
           Apache --> Tomcat V7 -->NEXT -->FINISH
@2:38 RIGHTCLICK->Start (Where new server wizard used to be)
          (It now says: Tomcat server at local host)
@3:06 RIGHTCLICK->Properties (on tomcat server at local host in servers panel)


@3:14 click on SWITCH LOCATION --> Apply --> Ok


@3:36 In project explorer (vertical panel on left)
           Servers --> TomCat --> RIGHT CLICK --> Properties --> ...WAIT... No...
@3:52 Severs panel. Double click on text "tomcat server..." this  horizontal panel.
@4:02 This setting looks dangerous.
           Check: Use Tomcat installation. (Takes control of tomcat installation)
@5:10 localhost:8080
@5:35 stop server.
@5:53 start server
@6:10 localhost:8080
DONE!

NOTE: I used the same "servers" folder/project for this tutorial and had to re-configure it. I am guessing it has broken my SpringyMoonShoes project.
