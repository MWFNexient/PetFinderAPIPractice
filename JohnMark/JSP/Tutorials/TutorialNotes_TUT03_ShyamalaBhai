Intro. Steps: 
1. Create dynamic web project.

Click FINISH @2:55  
We now have JSP project showing up in solution explorer. 
@3:27 First step is now finished.   

Now at "Create a JSP" step. 

@3:30: If you want to execute one of these files, you need to explicitly create it. @4:41: We are creating either index.jsp or default.jsp then. 
@4:40: .JSP files : Put into WebContent folder (THE ROOT. Not in WEB-INF)           
.HTML files: "Java Resources" folder. 
@5:10: WebContent --> RIGHTCLICK --> New --> JSP File 
@6:21: (Tail End) Use index.JSP as name.             
Must use one of the .JSP file names mentioned in web.xml file.

"Select JSP Template" page.            
Choose this template:            
New JSP File (Html) : JSP with HTML Markup            
Click FINISH @6:54- 8:25 Nothing special. 
Just writes HTML inside a .jsp file template. 

@8:25- 8:39 : Time for step3: Deploying project on TomCat. 
@8:39- 9:02 : In project explorer find: WEB-INF / index.jsp
