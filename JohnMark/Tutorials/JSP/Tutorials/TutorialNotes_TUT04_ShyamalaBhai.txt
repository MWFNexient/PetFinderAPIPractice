@:20: Scritping tags.
Scriplet      :   <%     %>
Expression    :   <%=    %>
Delcaration   :   <%!    %>

@1:08
Webcontent > new > new JSP file > name: index.jsp
Next > JSP with HTML mark up. > FINISH.

@1:50 Scriplet tag:
<% %> @:2:06
<%
out.print("hello world");
%>

@2:40: Running on server. END @3:00

@3:00 Expression tag.
Does not need terminator ";"
<%=   %>
sum is:
<%=
4+7
%>
Run as > Run on server.

@4:39
Declaration tag
<%! %>
Can declare an integer or method inside this tag.
Goto index.jsp
<%!
int a=5;
%>
the value of a is
@5:53 <%= a %>

I think I get it.
Expression tag lets you display information.
While the Scriplet and Declaration tags let you
set stuff in the "back end" so to speak.

@5:59: R-Click index.jsp --> run as --> run on server.

@6:57: Writing add(..) function inside a DECLARATION flag.

So...
I am thinking:
Use delcaration tags to make all your functions.
Then use scriplet tag to call your "main" entry point.

Are declaration tags simply down-graded scriptlet tags?
What is the scope of a declaration tag compared to a scriplet tag?

@7:33: Still writing add function.
@7:53: Moving onto expression tag.
Calling add() from the expression tag.
<%= add(3,4) %>

@8:33: RightClick Index.jsp in solution explorer
run > run on server

Summary:
Expression Tag : <%=  %>
Declaration Tag: <%!= %>
Scriptlet Tag  : <% %>

<%= used to display values. Think of it as a print statement. %>
<%! Used to declare functions and variables. %>
<%! you can write and entire java function in here. %>
<%  You write full scripts in here. I am going to think ot %>
<%  This tag as an anonymous function block. %>
<%  I am guessing within the scriplet tag you can %>
<%  call previously declared functions. %>
