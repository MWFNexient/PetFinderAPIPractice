Summary: Making forms on HTML page that will make request
to .JSP file.

Note: Didn't notice .XML here.
Just .HTML and .JSP interaction.


Did this:
<%
String uname = request.getParameter(youSirName);
out.print("hello " + youSirName);
%>

With the two bugs fixed:
<%
String uname = request.getParameter("youSirName");
out.print("hello " + uname);
%>
....

request.getParameter.... is returning NULL.
