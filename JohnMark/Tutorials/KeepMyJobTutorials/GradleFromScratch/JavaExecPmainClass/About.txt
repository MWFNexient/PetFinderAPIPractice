
Building on command line instructions:

* == Summary of what to do on command line.
$ == type this verbatam on command line after $ symbol.

On command line:
1. * change directory to point to PrjRoot
2. $ gradle -PmainClass=hello.HelloWorld execute

NOTES:
This is for the example that uses JavaExec on the command line.
I am not sure what the benifits on this method are. Because it
seems to involve:
1. More hard coding in the build.gradle file.
2. A more specific statement on the command line.
